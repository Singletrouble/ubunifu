            <p>Over the past 100 years, alot of areas in life have been <br>
                revolutionized but education is not one of them. Historically, higher <br>
                education has avoided competitive disruption. One reason for this <br>
                past immunity is the power of prestige in the higher education <br>
                 marketplace, where the quality of the product is hard to measure. At <br>
                 Ubunifu Our focus is to graduate all students innovation ready, ready <br>
                  to solve problems creatively.</p>
